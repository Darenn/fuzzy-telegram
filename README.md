Fuzzy-telegram is a C++ library for competitive programming events like condingame contests.
I choose to do it myself instead of take codes from other because that way I will learn a lot (as I am a student and do this for fun and pratice).
Feel free to use it (under GPLv3 licence) for your own projects.
Don't hesitate to help me improve this library.
